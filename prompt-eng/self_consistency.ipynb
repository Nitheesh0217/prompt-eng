    "# Self Consistency Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more advanced techniques in prompt engineering is self-consistency, introduced by `Wang et al. (2022)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method seeks to improve upon the traditional greedy decoding typically used in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept involves sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT and leveraging these variations to determine the most consistent answer. The technique  enhances the effectiveness of CoT prompting, particularly for tasks requiring arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.\n",

      "## **Project Overview**\n",
      "\n",
      "Our goal is to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting consumer purchasing behavior based on various factors such as demographic data, past purchase history, and online activity. We employed a comprehensive dataset containing detailed information about millions of users across different industries and products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The methodology involved a rigorous feature selection process followed by the application of multiple machine learning algorithms to ensure robustness in prediction accuracy and reliability. This report focuses on presenting key findings, evaluation metrics, and an interpretation of how these metrics contribute to understanding the model's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## **Data & Methodologies**\n",
      "\n",
      "We utilized datasets from diverse sources including e-commerce platforms, online behavior logs, and customer surveys to create a comprehensive data pool for training our predictive models. The methodologies included feature engineering to extract meaningful insights, handling missing data through imputation techniques, and rigorous cross-validation protocols to ensure model generalizability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary machine learning algorithms used were Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Neural Networks due to their proven effectiveness in handling high-dimensional datasets with complex relationships. These models were trained using an iterative process that adjusted parameters based on performance indicators like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
      "\n",
