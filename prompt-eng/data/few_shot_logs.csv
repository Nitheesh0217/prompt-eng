This will be achieved through the integration of AI-based test generation and automated bug detection capabilities.\n\n   ## Problem Statement\n   Traditional quality assurance methods are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error. These limitations can lead to missed bugs, increased testing costs, and a longer time to market for new software releases. The introduction of an automated QA system aims to address these issues.\n\n   ## Key Objectives\n   1) To successfully integrate AI-based test generation into the existing QA framework, enhancing both the volume and quality of tests generated. This will significantly reduce the manual workload associated with creating new tests.\n   2) To develop automated bug detection capabilities that can accurately identify errors in software applications. This will enhance the overall accuracy and reliability of the testing process.\n\n   ## Scope\n   The scope of this project includes the development and implementation of an automated QA system for web and mobile platforms. The solution should be scalable, adaptable to various testing environments, and compatible with existing QA tools and methodologies. It is important to note that while this initial phase focuses on web and mobile platforms, future iterations may explore the extension of these capabilities to other software development areas such as desktop applications or game testing."
