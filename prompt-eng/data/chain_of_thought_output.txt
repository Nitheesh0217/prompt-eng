Project Report: Financial Literacy Research Using Machine Learning
===========================================================

Overview
--------

This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms that accurately classifies individuals based on their level of financial literacy and predicts the risk levels associated with poor financial decisions.

### Project Title: Research on Financial Literacy Using Machine Learning

### Problem Statement: 
Many individuals lack the fundamental knowledge and skills necessary for making informed financial decisions. This lack of understanding can lead to potential financial instability and vulnerability, posing significant risks in personal finance management.

### Goal: 
To develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms that accurately classifies individuals based on their level of financial literacy and predicts the risk levels associated with poor financial decisions.

### Key Objectives:

1. **Data Gathering and Curation:** Gather comprehensive datasets that include demographic information, socioeconomic factors, and assessments of financial knowledge.
2. **Algorithm Development:** Employ supervised learning methods to build a predictive model capable of identifying individuals with varying degrees of financial literacy.
3. **Feature Analysis:** Identify the most influential features contributing to the prediction accuracy and understand their significance in relation to financial literacy.

### Scope:
The research will focus on a specific population group (e.g., young adults, low-income communities) as the primary data source. The scope does not include developing a fully deployed application or intervention program.

Methodology
------------

### Data & Methods

#### **Data Sources**

* Utilize publicly available datasets containing demographic information, socioeconomic indicators such as income, and education level, along with financial literacy assessments.
* **Example Datasets:** National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) by Federal Reserve Board

#### **Data Preprocessing**

* Prepare the data for machine learning algorithms by:
	+ Encoding categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
	+ Handling missing values through imputation methods like mean, median, or mode imputation.
	+ Creating new features based on domain expertise.

## Code Snippets
```python
# Import necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn)
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load and preprocess the dataset using pandas
data = pd.read_csv('financial_literacy_data.csv')

# Define features (X) and target variable (y)
features = ['age', 'education_level', 'income']
target = 'financial_literacy_score'

X = data[features]
y = data[target]

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```
Results & Evaluation
-------------------

### Results Overview

* **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified instances across different financial literacy levels.
* **Precision**: Model's ability to accurately predict high financial literacy cases.
* **Recall**: Model's capability to capture all positive (highly literate) cases.
* **F1-Score**: Balanced precision and recall for a comprehensive performance metric.

### Evaluation Metrics

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Function to evaluate model performance
def evaluate_model(model):
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
    print("Precision:", precision_score(y_test, predictions))
    print("Recall:", recall_score(y_test, predictions))
    print("F1-Score:", f1_score(y_test, predictions))

# Example evaluation with trained model
evaluate_model(trained_model)
```

Discussion & Conclusion
--------------------

### Discussion

* Interpret the results of the predictive model and discuss the most influential factors contributing to financial literacy.
* Analyze potential limitations of the model that may affect its accuracy or generalizability.

### Conclusion
Summarize key insights gained from the research on financial literacy drivers and propose future directions for addressing educational gaps through tailored interventions based on the identified risk factors.

### Supporting Code

```python
# Additional code for feature importance analysis using permutation importance
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance

def permutation_importance_analysis(model, X_test):
    result = permutation_importance(model, X_test, y_test)
    print(result.importances_mean)

# Example usage with trained model
permutation_importance_analysis(trained_model, X_test)
```
