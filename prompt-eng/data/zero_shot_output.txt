# Report Skeleton: Health Tracking Chatbot 

## Project Overview

- **Project Title:** Health Tracking Chatbot
- **Problem Statement:** Many individuals struggle to consistently track their health metrics (sleep, exercise, nutrition) due to lack of time, motivation, or accessible tools. This can lead to delayed identification of potential health issues and hinder progress towards wellness goals. 
- **Goal:** Develop a user-friendly chatbot that empowers users to effectively monitor their health by providing convenient tracking mechanisms, personalized insights, and motivational support.
- **Key Objectives:**
  - Objective 1: Design an intuitive conversational interface for easy data input (sleep duration, exercise type & intensity, meals consumed).
  - Objective 2: Implement algorithms to analyze user data and generate personalized health reports and recommendations.
  - Objective 3: Integrate motivational features (reminders, progress tracking, rewards) to encourage consistent engagement with the chatbot.
- **Scope:** The project will focus on developing a prototype chatbot capable of tracking sleep, exercise, and basic nutrition information. Future iterations may expand to include integration with wearable devices and personalized health plans.

## Methodology

- **Data & Methods:**
    - Data Collection: User input will be collected through natural language processing (NLP) techniques within the chatbot interface.
    - Data Analysis: Statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms will be employed to identify patterns and generate insights from user data.
    - Evaluation: The chatbot's effectiveness will be evaluated based on user feedback, engagement metrics (frequency of use, completion rates), and accuracy of generated insights.

- **Notebook Code Blocks:**
  ```python
  # Example: NLP code for extracting health data from user input
  import spacy 

  nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
  user_input = "I slept for 7 hours last night and went for a 30-minute run."
  doc = nlp(user_input)

  # Extract relevant information (sleep duration, exercise type & duration)
  ```
## Results & Evaluation

 - **Results Overview:** [Document key findings from user testing and data analysis. For example: percentage of users who consistently tracked their health metrics, improvement in sleep quality or exercise frequency observed.]
- **Evaluation Metrics:**

    - User Engagement: Track chatbot usage frequency, session duration, and completion rates for different tasks (data input, report viewing). 
    - Data Accuracy: Evaluate the accuracy of the chatbot's data extraction and analysis algorithms.
    - User Satisfaction: Conduct surveys or interviews to gather feedback on the chatbot's usability, helpfulness, and overall experience.

## Discussion & Conclusion

 - **Discussion:** [Analyze the results obtained in the context of the project goals. Discuss potential limitations of the chatbot and areas for improvement.]
- **Conclusion:** [Summarize key takeaways from the project and highlight the impact of the chatbot on user health tracking habits. Propose future development directions, such as integrating with wearable devices or expanding to other health domains.]
