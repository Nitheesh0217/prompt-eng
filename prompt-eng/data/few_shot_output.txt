# Report: Financial Literacy Research Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

### **Project Title**: _Research on Financial Literacy Using Machine Learning_

### **Problem Statement**: 
Many individuals lack the fundamental knowledge and skills necessary to make informed financial decisions, leading to potential financial instability and vulnerability. The project aims to address this issue by leveraging machine learning techniques to better understand and predict factors influencing financial literacy.

### **Goal**:
Develop a predictive model using machine learning capable of identifying key drivers of financial literacy and assessing individual risk levels.

### **Key Objectives**:

1. Gather and curate a comprehensive dataset encompassing demographic information, socioeconomic factors, and financial knowledge assessments.
2. Employ supervised learning algorithms (e.g., classification, regression) to build an accurate predictive model for financial literacy levels.
3. Identify the most influential features contributing to the prediction model's accuracy.

### **Scope**:
Focus on building a proof-of-concept predictive model for a specific population group (e.g., young adults, low-income communities). Does not include developing a fully deployed application or intervention program.

## Methodology

### Data & Methods:

#### Data Sources:
Identify and utilize relevant datasets containing demographic information, socioeconomic indicators (e.g., income, education level), and financial literacy assessments. Explore publicly available databases or conduct surveys to collect necessary data.

#### Feature Engineering:
Preprocess raw data into suitable features for machine learning algorithms. This includes encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and creating new features based on domain expertise.

### Notebook Code Blocks:

```python
# Import necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn)
import pandas as pd 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load and preprocess the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('financial_literacy_data.csv')

X = data[['age', 'education', 'income']]
y = data['financial_literacy_score']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```

## Results & Evaluation

### Results Overview:
Present key findings from the developed machine learning model using visualizations like accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and feature importance plots.

### Evaluation Metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Measure of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: Model's ability to predict positive cases accurately (high financial literacy).
- **Recall**: Model's ability to capture all positive cases.
- **F1-Score**: Balance between precision and recall for comprehensive performance metric.

## Discussion & Conclusion

### Discussion:
Interpret the results, discussing influential factors contributing to financial literacy. Analyze potential limitations of the model and propose areas for improvement.

### Conclusion:
Summarize key insights gained into drivers of financial literacy and suggest future directions, such as developing targeted interventions based on identified risk factors.

## Appendix/Additional Resources

### Supporting Code:
Include additional code snippets for data preprocessing, model training, and visualization:

```python
# Additional code for feature importance analysis
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance

result = permutation_importance(model, X_test, y_test, n_repeats=10)
print(result.importances_mean)
```

### Data Sources:
Provide detailed information on datasets used in the research, including links to publicly available resources.
